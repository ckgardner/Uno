# Web Sockets Markdown

Who doesn't love to play Uno? This web socket app allows users to link up using web sockets and play with each other in real time. All of the normal Uno rules were implemented. In addition to the rules, I created a chat bubble. Trash talk is a must, in any competitive environment. This makes it so even when you may be far apart, the fights don't have to end.
